//! The persistent tool cache: what each server advertised the last time it was
//! listed.
//!
//! A host wants a server's tools *before* the server is reachable — at boot,
//! on a resumed conversation, on a turn that must not wait for a subprocess to
//! spawn. This table is that answer. It is written whenever a listing
//! succeeds and read without touching the network.
//!
//! # A cache, not an authorization
//!
//! A row says what a server offered, not that it may be called. Calling still
//! goes through a live connection, which re-checks everything. That is why a
//! disconnect keeps the row and an uninstall or a disable removes it: the
//! first is a state that will change back, the other two are the user saying
//! the server's tools should stop appearing.
//!
//! # Keyed by a fingerprint of the definition
//!
//! Each row carries a digest of what the server *is* — transport, endpoint,
//! command, arguments, and the names (never the values) of its credentials.
//! A read whose fingerprint differs misses, so editing a server's definition
//! can never surface the old server's tools under the new one.
